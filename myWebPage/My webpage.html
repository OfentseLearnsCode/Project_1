    <h3>Optimism</h3>
    
<p>Optimism can be defined as “Hopefulness and confidence about the future or the success of something” (en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition, n.d.) or more specifically as “extent to which people hold generalized favorable expectancies for their future” (Birkeland, Blix, & Heir, 2007). <br>
    It’s a characteristic trait which is unique and observed in certain individuals. It’s a form of mental state in which, one believes that the outcome of some specific task or result, will be positive or good.</p>
<p>There are many reasons to be optimistic. First of all, optimism is based on a realistic view of the world.<br> People who are optimistic understand that life is full of ups and downs, but they believe that the good times will eventually outweigh the bad.</p>
    
<p>Optimism is a powerful determinant to an individual’s success, happiness, and impact on society, whether or not the world’s problems are solved. According to Collins Dictionary, optimism is “the tendency to take the most hopeful or cheerful view of matters or to expect the best outcome”.<br> An optimistic person is known to have a positive outlook on life and believe that we live in ‘the best of all possible worlds’.</p>
